### Database server

✅  Before your interview, write a program that runs a server that is accessible on 'http://localhost:4000/'.

[ ] When your server receives a request on `http://localhost:4000/set?somekey=somevalue` it should store the passed key and value in memory. When it receives a request on `http://localhost:4000/get?key=somekey` it should return the value stored at `somekey`.

[ ] During your interview, you will pair on saving the data to a file. You can start with simply appending each write to the file, and work on making it more efficient if you have time.
